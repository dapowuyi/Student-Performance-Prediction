# Student-Performance-Prediction

This is a machine learning program to predict student performance based on a two datasets

The aim of the project is to identify key indicators that affect student performance by modeling a small dataset and using this to create a prediction model. It requires using a variety of models and algorithms such as Random forest regression and classification, support vector machine and  to know the model with the best and most reliable accuracy to use for student performance prediction.

It involves exploratory data analysis, visualization and fitting and training a regression model and three classification models with hyperparameter tuning.
